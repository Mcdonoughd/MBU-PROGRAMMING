//int argc is the number of arguments passed with the program
//char* argv[] are the arguments themselves
int main(int argc,char* argv[]) {
	//This is a for loop that prints all the arguments given
	//Note how the first argument (0th element) is the file path for the program
	cout << "The Arguments given were:" << endl;
	//a For loop does all the commands inside the block until the condition is satisfied
	for(int i = 0; i<=argc-1; i++){ //here, our condition is that i is <= to the number of arguments minus one.
		cout << argv[i] << endl;
	}//when the loop reaches the end of the block, the computer checks if the condition is satisfied. if not it does i++ (or i= i+1)
	//once the condition is satisfied, the for loop exits the block

	//main should ALWAYS return 0
	return 0;
	//if not it's considered an error!
