/*
 * Santa has a list of everyone in the world. Keeping track of it is such a hassle.
 * It takes a long time to go through all the names, just to find the one he needs.
 * Santa needs your help to develop a program that allows for quick, organized searches
 * of his list. Given a test program, add your name to the bottom of the list.
 * Then using the example data structures, implement one that allows your name to be searched
 * faster than in the regular list and compare the two.
 *

	//then change it so it compares Strings, not ints
	//make sure you populate it with the same list
